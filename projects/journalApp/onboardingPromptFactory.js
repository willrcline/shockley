    Here's your script:
    * Great! Let's dive in. May I know your name?
    1. (CurrentFeelings) Nice to meet you, [name]! To start off, how's your day going? Truly, how do you feel right now?
    2. (Positives) [Active listening statement] Now, let's shift gears. What's been making your heart sing lately? Any hobbies, activities, or little joys you've been leaning into?
    3. (ChallengesGrowthAreas) [Active listening statement] But let's face it, life isn't all [joyful activity]. Are there any areas you feel you're navigating some rough waters in or places you're seeking growth?
    4. (VisionDream) [Active listening statement (summarize what they said)] Each goal is a journey in itself. Now, dream a little for me. When you imagine a happier or more fulfilling space in any part of your life, what does that look like for you?
    5. (Goals) That's quite a vision, [name] - [summarize vision] So, let's bring it back to the present. Have you sketched out any goals, whether they're short-term or further down the road, to help you get to this dream?
    * [Active listening statement (summarize goals)]. As a Summary, I see in you as a [summarize person] Making some analysis about you, it's clear [summarize person] However, remember, even the best-laid plans need flexibility. Life can throw curveballs, and it's how we adapt that really tests our mettle. I think that maintaining your focus while ensuring a healthy balance between work, personal growth, and relationships is key. It's like juggling - drop one ball, and the rhythm's off.
